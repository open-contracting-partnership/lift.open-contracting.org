What makes a<br>good Lift candidate?</h2>
<div class="container--grid marginTop">
<div class="eligibilityDetail">
<h3 class="color--white">Dynamic, collaborative teams.</h3>
<p>Your team should include a Relationship Manager who is skilled at building political support and navigating bureaucracy, a Procurement Expert who is knowledgeable about navigating the procurement system, a Technical and/or Data Expert who is knowledgeable about procurement data publication, analysis and use and/or is familiar in using technology solutions, and two Team Leads, who have the authority and capacity to coordinate the team and drive the project forward.</p>
</div>
<div class="eligibilityDetail">
<h3 class="color--white">Goals and plans for impact from open contracting.</h3>
<p>Lift is open to teams around the globe that want to use procurement as a lever for better economic, social, or environmental outcomes. You have a clear goal in mind and a problem that you are trying to solve—at the national, regional, or city level—that addresses one of our challenge question topics. You also have clear beneficiaries in mind and can articulate who in your community will benefit from this project.</p>
</div>
<div class="eligibilityDetail">
<h3 class="color--white">Projects that aim for systemic change.</h3>
<p>Lift is for systemic reform projects that seek to make progress across policy, processes, capacity, and data. It is not for general capacity building on open contracting or advocacy. While training, workshops, and open data publication and tools are important, they cannot be the whole of your Lift project—they should just be a means to reach your systemic goal.</p>
</div>
<div class="eligibilityDetail">
<h3 class="color--white">Projects with buy-in and momentum, at all levels of maturity.</h3>
<p>Your reform project should already have acceptance and support of some senior leadership that can help you move your project forward, make significant changes, and overcome opposition. Teams can be working on projects at different stages of development. You could be embarking on a new initiative, or working to refine and scale a piloted solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="eligibilityDetail">
<h3 class="color--white">Teams who have the capacity and power to drive change.</h3>
<p>Lift is all about having the capacity to make your big idea a reality. You should have a team who can dedicate significant time to drive this project forward on a weekly basis, team leaders who can commit for the duration of the program, data and IT infrastructure in place, and a budget to fund your time and your essential activities. You are eager to get input from your community on how you can better meet their needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="eligibilityDetail">
<h3 class="color--white">Teams who bring together allies in reform.</h3>
<p>We have seen that the strongest and most successful reform teams typically work together across sectors and silos, so we are especially looking for cross-departmental or cross-organizational collaborations. We strongly encourage teams to apply as a coalition of actors. As part of the application, we also ask for the commitment of your co-leads for the program duration of 18 months, and prefer that they come from two different agencies, departments, or organizations to promote collaboration in their respective entities. However, stand-alone applicants from civil society/nonprofit organizations or government agencies with outstanding applications and teams will be considered as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="eligibilityDetail">
<h3 class="color--white">Approaches that could be replicated or scaled.</h3>
<p>In the past, several Lift teams have used the program to test new approaches that they later scaled up in more regions, sectors, or agencies after the program’s end. We are interested in supporting projects that have this potential. Consider if your project includes processes, tools, or changes that you could improve and adapt for others to bring into their work.</p>
