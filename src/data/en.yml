  ## 02. About Lift

  about:
    heading: About Lift
    text: >
      <p>As governments and social leaders around the world grapple to address the converging crises of inequality, climate change, and a decline in public trust, every single one of them has a powerful and untapped tool at their disposal: public procurement.</p>
      <p>Open contracting is a tested approach to reimagine public procurement to deliver systemic change. Lift is our program to help teams of bold reformers to redesign processes, policies, and data to make them goal-driven, user-friendly and human-centered. Your challenge could be…</p>

    graphic:
      theme1:
        heading: Corruption, low trust in government, or a lack of representation. 
        text: You might want to use open contracting to improve your country’s public spending and integrity through implementing better red flagging approaches, increasing competition and reducing sole sourcing. Or you might want to improve monitoring and advocacy by empowering citizens, businesses, journalists and others to track and report procurement failures and making government agencies accountable to responding to them.
      theme2:
        heading: Government spending and investments that don’t meet climate goals and needs.
        text: You might want to use open contracting to expand access to affordable and green public transit, purchase more sustainably-produced or longer-lasting products, or measurably reduce the amount of carbon emissions from public purchasing. Or you might be trying to advance climate mitigation priorities and enable smarter decision-making around how disaster prevention investments are made. 
      theme3:
        heading: Purchasing or public services that reinforce social inequities.
        text: You might want to use open contracting to improve vendor diversity by boosting opportunities for women-, youth- or minority-owned businesses to participate in public procurement, or build the capacity of small, local suppliers to compete and win government contracts. Or you might want to improve service delivery by improving social safety net programs, helping stock hospitals fairly with the best medicines and protective equipment, or equipping public schools with the supplies and infrastructure they need to serve students and their families.

  ## 01. Eligibility checklist

  checklistIntro: >
    All applicants teams should be:

  checklist:

    checklist1: Pursuing a project that aims to use open contracting to achieve one of three goals of anti-corruption, sustainability, or inclusion.

    checklist2: Comprised of a strong team that includes at least four people integral to project implementation, including two team leads, a relationship manager, and procurement and data experts.

    checklist3: Committed to participate fully in the 18-month program.

    checklist4: Working in a country deemed “Good,” “Satisfactory,” “Problematic,” or “Difficult” by the <a href="https://rsf.org/en/index">World Press Freedom Index 2022</a>.


  ## 02. Eligibility details

  details:
    heading: What makes a <br>good Lift candidate?

    text:

      text1:
        heading: Dynamic, collaborative teams.
        text: Your team should include a Relationship Manager who is skilled at building political support and navigating bureaucracy, a Procurement Expert who is knowledgeable about navigating the procurement system, a Technical and/or Data Expert who is knowledgeable about procurement data publication, analysis and use and/or is familiar in using technology solutions, and two Team Leads, who have the authority and capacity to coordinate the team and drive the project forward. 

      text2:
        heading: Goals and plans for impact from open contracting.
        text: Lift is open to teams around the globe that want to use procurement as a lever for better economic, social, or environmental outcomes. You have a clear goal in mind and a problem that you are trying to solve—at the national, regional, or city level—that addresses one of our challenge question topics. You also have clear beneficiaries in mind and can articulate who in your community will benefit from this project.

      text3:
        heading: Projects that aim for systemic change.
        text: Lift is for systemic reform projects that seek to make progress across policy, processes, capacity, and data. It is not for general capacity building on open contracting or advocacy. While training, workshops, and open data publication and tools are important, they cannot be the whole of your Lift project—they should just be a means to reach your systemic goal.

      text4:
        heading: Projects with buy-in and momentum, at all levels of maturity.
        text: Your reform project should already have acceptance and support of some senior leadership that can help you move your project forward, make significant changes, and overcome opposition. Teams can be working on projects at different stages of development. You could be embarking on a new initiative, or working to refine and scale a piloted solution. 

      text5:
        heading: Teams who have the capacity and power to drive change.
        text: Lift is all about having the capacity to make your big idea a reality. You should have a team who can dedicate significant time to drive this project forward on a weekly basis, team leaders who can commit for the duration of the program, data and IT infrastructure in place, and a budget to fund your time and your essential activities. You are eager to get input from your community on how you can better meet their needs. 

      text6:
        heading: Teams who bring together allies in reform.
        text: We have seen that the strongest and most successful reform teams typically work together across sectors and silos, so we are especially looking for cross-departmental or cross-organizational collaborations. We strongly encourage teams to apply as a coalition of actors. As part of the application, we also ask for the commitment of your co-leads for the program duration of 18 months, and prefer that they come from two different agencies, departments, or organizations to promote collaboration in their respective entities. However, stand-alone applicants from civil society/nonprofit organizations or government agencies with outstanding applications and teams will be considered as well. 

      text7:
        heading: Approaches that could be replicated or scaled.
        text: In the past, several Lift teams have used the program to test new approaches that they later scaled up in more regions, sectors, or agencies after the program’s end. We are interested in supporting projects that have this potential. Consider if your project includes processes, tools, or changes that you could improve and adapt for others to bring into their work.

    heading: Applications

    questions:

      question1:
        summary: What makes a good application?
        details: >
          <p>The best applications will start with a very specific goal or problem that relates to using procurement to power an effective or inclusive recovery. You might want to improve the quality of school meals or school infrastructure, expand access to reliable public transportation, make public purchases more environmentally-friendly, or aim to give more contracting opportunities to women- or minority-owned businesses. In your application, be as specific as possible about how better contracting processes will help you achieve these goals.</p>

          <p>Note that Lift is not for general capacity building on open contracting or advocacy. While training, workshops, and OCDS publication and tools and advocacy are important, they cannot be the whole of your Lift project—they should just be a means to serve your goal.</p>

          <p>Also, we encourage you to be clear about how you will measure and track progress against your goals. For example, potential metrics might be the number of women-owned businesses who win contracts, feedback from residents about the quality of food or the cleanliness of public parks, infrastructure projects completed on time and within budget, etc.</p>

      question2:
        summary: What are the key questions that I should think about before submitting an application?
        details: >
          <p>We require that you answer all questions and submit a complete application. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-c63jnsrmUjgxM4LBD3ERqKSEw1LEcNXxnDJnqGK6kY/edit?usp=sharing">View the application questions here. </a>To make the best application possible, focus especially on developing concrete answers to these four questions:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>What is the problem that you are seeking to address through Lift?&nbsp;</li>
          <ul>
          <li>Tip: Focus on a specific goal or problem relating to the quality of public goods, works, or services, or access to opportunity. Explain how this problem relates to an inclusive and effective recovery from the pandemic.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <li>What is the solution to this problem?</li>
          <ul>
          <li>Tip: Think beyond implementing the OCDS, rolling out a new platform or tool, or running workshops. Instead, explain what the future that you want to see is and the concrete outcomes you anticipate by the Lift program&rsquo;s end in June of 2022.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>What are your &lsquo;powers&rsquo; to make change happen, and who in power will help you make this change happen?&nbsp;</li>
          <ul>
          <li>Tip: Lift is for teams that can achieve measurable improvements in public goods, works, and services or expand economic opportunity as part of supporting an inclusive and effective recovery. This requires that Lift teams have the power to make change. You might have to change regulations or policies, upgrade data or IT infrastructure or rethink processes - doing so often requires political buy-in and robust mandates for change. Consider what organizational strategies or key relationships that give you the power to pursue your work.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Who is on your core team, and why are they involved?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Tip: Lift is for teams that have skills and represent the agencies or organizations that are integral for project success. For example, if your project is about improving the quality of public housing through procurement reform, it would be smart to have someone on the team who is from the public housing agency.</p>

    heading: Project

    questions:

      question6:
        summary: At what stage or scale should my project be to apply? Does it have to be an idea, prototype, or MVP? Should it be focused locally or globally?
        details: >
          <p>Lift is open to projects at different stages of development and scale. You could be embarking on a new initiative, or working to refine and scale a piloted solution. We require that your project has leadership support, which might include a budget for your work, a political champion, or a formal mandate. You could also be solving problems in your region, country, or city. Your project does not need to be able to scale globally.</p>

      question8:
        summary: Are there any sectors or topics Lift is particularly interested in?
        details: >
          <p>No, we are open to a wide range of sectors. You qualify for Lift as long as you are working for a more inclusive and effective recovery through increased openness in procurement, regardless of sector. For example, your focus could be on education, health, infrastructure, transportation, or expanding economic opportunity.</p>

      question9:
        summary: Can my project be for implementing the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) or OC4IDS?
        details: >
          <p>We are looking for projects that go beyond implementing OCDS or OC4IDS. Your project should be focused on improving a public good, work, or service and using the OCDS as a tool to achieve that goal. However, implementing OCDS or OC4IDS may be one part of your project.</p>
          <p>If your focus is solely on implementing OCDS or OC4IDS, Lift is not for you. But please reach out to our helpdesk at data@open-contracting.org who is happy to support anyone interested in implementing OCDS.</p>

      question10:
        summary: Is adopting and/or implementing the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) or OC4IDS required to be eligible for the program?
        details: >
          <p>No, but we do expect that your reform initiative involves making information or data more accessible. Lift can provide support in implementing <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/data-standard/">OCDS</a> or OC4IDS if it is part of your project.</p>
          <p>Want to learn more about OCDS or OC4IDS? Visit the <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/data-standard/">OCP website</a> for information and resources.</p>

    heading: Team

    questions:

      question11:
        summary: How can I be sure my team is the right fit for this program?
        details: >
          <p>This impact-oriented program is best suited for teams who are:&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Focused on improving the quality of public goods, works, or services,</li>

          <li>Able and committed to investing the time required over the course of the program.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Open Contracting Lift is not for teams who only want support on tool development or <a href="http://standard.open-contracting.org/">Open Contracting Data Standard</a> implementation.</p>

          <p>In addition, one of your team members should be the <strong>Team Leader</strong>, who has the authority and capacity to coordinate the team and drive the project forward. If your project requires a technical solution, your team should also have a <strong>technical expert</strong> who can help build your solution.</p>
          <p>We suggest you keep your teams to 3 to 10 people for easy management.</p>

      question13:
        summary: Should my team be from one organization or a collaboration of multiple organizations?
        details: >
          <p>While we welcome teams from one organization, we are particularly interested in teams that represent collaborative partnerships. In the past we have seen that teams that bring together many diverse actors from different stakeholder groups and government agencies are more effective in achieving change.</p>

      question14:
        summary: How many teams will you select?
        details: >
          <p>We will select up to 7 teams for the program.</p>

          <p>Lift will consider working in countries that are deemed to be in a &ldquo;difficult situation&rdquo; (color: red) according to the index when applicants can demonstrate during the application process that there is collaboration amongst selected government and civil society actors and a partially safe space that civil society can work in.</p>
          <p>We are not looking for any particular countries, but for a geographic spread so that the Lift cohort includes a diverse mix of contexts.&nbsp;</p>

          <li>Effectively build leadership support to drive a robust mandate for your project.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Improve use of open data and open data systems to manage, monitor, and advance the quality of delivery of public goods, works, and services or expand access to opportunity.&nbsp;</li>
